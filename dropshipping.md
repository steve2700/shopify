# üßæ What Is Dropshipping?

**Dropshipping** is a business model where you sell products **without holding inventory**.

## üõí How It Works:
1. A customer places an order on your Shopify store.
2. You forward the order to your supplier (automatically or manually).
3. The supplier **packs and ships** the product directly to the customer.
4. You keep the **profit margin** (the difference between selling price and supplier price).

> üß† You never touch the product yourself ‚Äî your job is **marketing and customer service**.

### ‚úÖ Pros:
- No inventory or warehouse needed
- Low startup cost
- Easy to test many products quickly

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons:
- Slower shipping times (especially from overseas)
- Quality control can be tricky
- You rely heavily on the supplier
